# Packet-Sniffer

Packet Sniffer that can be run in terminal easily. Soon to have a GUI. Now compatible with .pcap and .csv formats!

### To start the program, run menu.py.

 You can edit some of the variables as you like within the menu.
By default, the packet sniffer runs for ~10s, exact timing is not implemented but I'm doing my best.

If you set the packet sniffer to run infinitely, to stop it use...

&emsp;*Windows + Linux*: Ctrl + "C"<br>

&emsp;*Mac*: Command + "."<br>
Planning on adding...
&emsp;- Graphic User Interface<br>
&emsp;- Maybe more information regarding the Pcap file...<br>
&emsp;- An actual name instead of just "Packet Sniffer"<br>

Thanks for reading, hope you enjoy! If you find any bugs, please let me know. FYI My machine is Windows so idk how it works on Mac.
