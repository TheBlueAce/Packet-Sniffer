# Packet-Sniffer

Packet Sniffer that can be run in terminal easily. Compatible with .pcap and .csv formats!

Works with Wireshark, Excel, and Splunk. More tools that support .pcap, .csv, and .txt formats accepted (I hope)!

### To start the program, run menu.py.

You can edit some of the variables as you like within the menu.
By default, the packet sniffer runs for ~10s, exact timing is not implemented, but I did my best.

If you set the packet sniffer to run infinitely, to stop it, use...<br>
&emsp;*Windows + Linux*: Ctrl + "C"<br>
&emsp;*Mac*: Command + "."<br>
Planning on adding...<br>
&emsp;- Graphic User Interface<br>
&emsp;- An actual name instead of just "Packet Sniffer"<br>

Thanks for reading, hope you enjoy! If you find any bugs, please let me know. FYI My machine is Windows so idk how it works on Mac.
